# Security Audit Report - Discord Bot

**Date:** 2025-03-20\
**Auditor:** arec1b0

## 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Bandit

**Result:** No security issues found

**Command Run:**

**Summary:**

- No high, medium, or low-severity issues were detected in the code.
- No hardcoded credentials, dangerous functions (`eval`, `exec`), or potential command injection risks.

**Next Steps:**

- Regularly run `bandit` before deployment.
- Consider integrating `bandit` into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous monitoring.

## 2. Dependency Security Scan - Safety & Pip-Audit

**Result:** No known vulnerabilities found

**Commands Run:**

**Initial Findings:**\
3 vulnerabilities detected before the update:

1. **Setuptools (****`<70.0.0`****) - CVE-2024-6345** (Remote Code Execution)
2. **Pip (****`<23.3`****) - CVE-2023-5752** (Command Injection)
3. **Pip (****`<25.0`****) - PVE-2025-75180** (Arbitrary Code Execution via wheel files)

**Fix Applied:**

- Upgraded `setuptools` and `pip` to the latest versions.
- Re-ran security scans, confirming **0 vulnerabilities after the update**.

**Next Steps:**

- Schedule **regular dependency scans** (weekly or before releases).
- Automate security checks in **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD**.

## 3. Permissions & Security Configuration Review

**Issue:** **Excessive Bot Permissions**

- `Intents.message_content = True` allows access to all messages.
- **Fix Recommended:** Disable unnecessary intents unless explicitly needed.

**Issue:** **No Rate Limiting on Commands**

- Commands (`!add`, `!delete`) can be spammed.
- **Fix Recommended:** Implement Discord cooldowns:

**Token Management Secure**

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` is loaded from `.env`, avoiding hardcoded secrets.
- **Fix Applied:** Added missing token validation to prevent accidental exposure.

---

## 4. SQL Security Review

**Issue:** **Potential SQL Injection Risks**

- While SQL queries are parameterized, SQLite does not enforce strong typing.
- **Fix Recommended:** Validate `task_id` as an integer before executing queries.

**Issue:** **Lack of Indexing on ****`user_id`**

- Could lead to performance degradation on large datasets.
- **Fix Recommended:** Add indexing:

---

## 5. Runtime Security Checks (DAST - Manual Testing)

**Planned but Not Yet Executed:**

- **Spam attack simulation:** Checking bot behavior under rapid command execution.
- **Privilege escalation test:** Ensure users cannot modify tasks of others.
- **Database stress test:** Load test to assess query efficiency.

**Next Steps:**

- Run dynamic tests in a controlled environment.
- Add **logging & monitoring** to detect abuse attempts.

---

## Final Recommendations & Next Steps

**Completed Fixes:**

- No vulnerabilities in dependencies after updates.
- Static code analysis passed (no major issues).
- Token management improved with validation.

**Recommended Fixes & Actions:**

1. **Restrict bot permissions** (disable `message_content` unless needed).
2. **Implement rate limits** on bot commands to prevent spam.
3. **Validate SQL inputs** to minimize injection risks.
4. **Add database indexing** for performance improvement.
5. **Automate security checks** in CI/CD pipeline.

**Next Steps:**

- Execute **DAST tests** to confirm runtime security.
- Set up **GitHub Actions for automated security scans**.
- Implement **logging & monitoring** to track command usage.

**Overall Security Rating: 7.5/10**\
**The bot is now significantly more secure, but runtime testing and permission adjustments are still needed.**
